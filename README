This directory contains an example Android client for https://3-dot-apprtc.appspot.com


Example of building & using the app:
android update project -p . --subprojects -t 17
ant debug
ant installd

In desktop chrome, navigate to https://apprtc.appspot.com and note the r=<NNN> room
this redirects to or navigate directly to https://apprtc.appspot.com/r/<NNN> with
your own room number. Launch AppRTC on the device and add same <NNN> into the room name list.

You can also run application from a command line to connect to the first room in a list:
adb shell am start -n org.appspot.apprtc/.ConnectActivity -a android.intent.action.VIEW
This should result in the app launching on Android and connecting to the 3-dot-apprtc
page displayed in the desktop browser.
To run loopback test execute following command:
adb shell am start -n org.appspot.apprtc/.ConnectActivity -a android.intent.action.VIEW --ez "org.appspot.apprtc.LOOPBACK" true
